### What is Paths? 
Paths is a simple, randomly generated puzzle game based on graph theory, specifically Euler's Path.

The goal is to simply connect all the dots (vertices) without reusing any edges.

You can control the number of vertices using the slider found on the top left of the screen.

### How does it work?
The game is created using JavaScript and React. It uses a few different algorithms to first generate a series of interconnected vertices, which also ensures that each puzzle is actually completable. 
It then uses a custom algorithm to assign coordinates to each vertex, preventing edge or vertex overlapping.
